            <h2>BF Skinner</h2>
            
                 <img class="center" src="images/B.F._Skinner.jpg" alt="B.F Skinner" > 
            
            <p>B.F Skinner was a psychologist, behaviorist as well as a professor of Psychology at Harvard University.</p>
            
            <p>Skinner was a genius when it came to understanding the behavior of individuals. He's known to be so effective in his works that he's even taught pigeons how to play ping-pong.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Operant Conditioning:</strong> The concept of operant conditioning looks at the effect of positive and negative reinforcement on behavior.</li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <li><strong>Positive Reinforcement:</strong> Skinner had a box called the Skinner box and in it he placed a rat. In the side of the box there was a lever which whenever he would hit accidentally, food would drop next to it. After a few times of the rat being put into the box, the rat would go straight to the lever. Because they would be given food by pressing the lever, they would continously do the action. 
                </li>
                <br />
                <br />
                <li><strong>Negative Reinforcement:</strong> If you do not turn in your assignment, your grade will drop. This will cause you to work on your assignment so your grades won't drop. This is negative reinforcement. Skinner was once again able to train rats as he placed them into a box and they were instantly hit by a electric shock. There would be a lever and everytime they hit it, the shock would get turned off. Thus everytime the rat was dropped in the box, it would go straight for the lever. </li>
            </ul>
