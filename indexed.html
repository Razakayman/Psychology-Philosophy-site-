            <h2>Philocology</h2>
            
            <p>Philosophy is defined as "the rational investigation of the truths and principles of being, knowledge, or conduct." 
            <br />
            Psychology on the other hand is defined as "the sum or characteristics of the mental states and processes of a person or class of persons, or of the mental states and processes involved in a field of activity."
            </p>
            
            <p>While both fields are different, they are also quite alike. While Philosophy looks that the truths and the ideals of mankind, psychology looks at the mental state and individual as a whole. These two come together to tell us a lot about ourselves and the lives we choose to live.</p>
            
            <p>This site will be looking at the 4 most important philosphers and psychologists in my opinion. There are plenty of other important individuals in both fields so I limited it to 4 that have changed the game for Philosophy and Psychology respectively. </p>
