            <h2>Jacques Lacan</h2>

            <p>Jacques Lacan is one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century. His most well known concept is the "Mirror Stage."</p>
            
            <p>Lacan states that human infants have a stage where they see an image of themselves, typically through a mirror, and develops an "I", otherwise known as an individual identity. Before seeing itself, the child doesn't know it's an individual. This causes a split between the ID and Ego(Sigmund Freud theories). </p>
            
            <p>Lacan believed that the mind required imagination, symbolism, and reality.</p>
            
            <p>The following is taken from<a href="http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/symbolicrealimaginary.htm"> University Of Chicago</a></p>
                
            <p><strong>Symbol Order: </strong>In contrast to the imaginary, the symbolic involves the formation of signifiers and language... Seeing the entire system of the unconscious/conscious as manifesting in an endless web of signifiers/ieds and associations, Lacan claims that, "Symbols in fact envelop the life of man in a network so total that they join together, before he comes into the world, those who are going to engender him…" (Language, 42). And, "Man speaks therefore, but it is because the symbol has made him man" (39). The Symbolic Order functions as the way in which the subject is organized and, to a certain extent, how the psyche becomes accessible. It is associated with language, with words, with writing and can be aligned with Peirce’s "symbol" and Saussure’s "signifier."</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Imaginary: </strong>"The imaginary becomes the internalized image of this ideal, whole, self and is situated around the notion of coherence rather than fragmentation. The imaginary can roughly be aligned with the formation of the ego which serves as the mediator (as in Freud) between the internal and the external world (Vogler, 2). It becomes, in Lacan, the space in which the relation "between the ego and its images" (Miller, 280) is developed. For Pierce, the imaginary is aligned with the "icon" – an image which is "understood" with no (or little) mediation (Pierce, 102); for Saussure the imaginary becomes the "signified" the concept symbolized arbitrarily by a sign (Saussure, 114)."</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Real:</strong> "Very unlike our conventional conception of objective/collective experience, in Lacanian theory the real becomes that which resists representation, what is pre-mirror, pre-imaginary, pre-symbolic – what cannot be symbolized – what loses it’s "reality" once it is symbolized (made conscious) through language."</p>
